Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

          ```1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...```

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## _Solution_ 👇 

```python
def sum_of_even(n) :
    a, b = 1, 1
    result = 0
    while a <= n:
      if a % 2 == 0:
        result += a
      a, b = b, a+b

    print(result)

# Return 4613732
```
